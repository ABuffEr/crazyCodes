# Crazy Codes #

A collection of brief codes, quite useless or unlikely applicable, to solve in a shorter or involved manner some relatively simple problems.

Problems that, for majority of cases, come from my friend and colleague [Emmanuel Schoysman][1], and which he uses to torture me for days and days. :)

## Splitter Regex ##

A exercise/challenge to build a (monstrous) regex to split a string, in all possible cases.

[Explanation](splitterRegex.md) and [Python code.](splitterRegex.py)

## Function Chooser ##

A code density exercise, to apply different functions on list items according to satisfied predicates.

[Explanation](functionChooser.md) and [Python code.](functionChooser.py)

## Padding Regex ##

An attempt to use regex for padding; in practice, a replacing example using a function rather than a pre-determined string.

[Explanation](paddingRegex.md) and [Python code.](paddingRegex.py)

## Compact Fast Modular Exponentiation ##

A challenge to minimize the well-known function for modular exponentiation.

[Explanation](compactModExp.md) and [Python code.](compactModExp.py)
